                     <p>I am available on Thursdays after class between 4:00-5:00pm for our office hours. If that
                        doesn't work, we can schedule a time to meet via Zoom. Please DM me on Discord. Meeting with me
                        is an important part in supporting you throughout this
                        course. Even if you don't have specific questions, needs, and concerns, I would love to talk
                        with you at least once during this semester. Don't be a stranger~</p>

                     <h3>What course materials do we need?</b></h3>
                     <p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>We'll be working on the <b>lab computers,</b> but a laptop/desktop of your own will come in
                           handy.</li>
                        <li>An <b>external hard drive.</b> It is a useful habit to be saving all your projects on your
                           own mobile harddrive so you can work between computers.</li>
                        <li>A <b>3 button mouse</b> is highly recommended. It is truly a game-changer.</li>
                        <li>We'll be working with <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank"><b>Blender</b></a>!
                           A super powerful 3D software that is also free and open-source! Hooray ^_^. </li>
                        <li>Outside of our weekly in-person classes, all communication happens on our <a href=""
                              target="_blank"><b>Discord server</b></a>. Consider it a hub where we share annoucements,
                           ideas, WIPs, and resources. It will become a place you can return back to for gems even after
                           the course ends :~) </li>
                     </ul>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>~~~</p>
                  <div>
                     <h3>What is this course?</b></h3>
                     <p>We'll be learning how to conceive, craft, and animate 3D environments. Through experimentation,
                        we'll engage with ideas around immersive environments, worldbuilding, and real-time techniques.
                        How do these properties intersect between cinema, animation, and games? By the end of the
                        course, we will create our own virtual environments into a final video project. As a class,
                        we'll look at digital art practices that engage on varying levels of virtual architecture,
                        sculpture, and environmental storytelling. Revisiting and discussing works that inspire us will
                        be as important as seeing works that approach moving image from different contexts. So that's
                        what we'll do!</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>~~~</p>



                  <div>
                     <h3>What will you learn in this course?</b></h3>
                     <p>We'll learn how to utilize Blender, a software, as a tool for experimental animation and
                        creative expression. Through this course, you'll be able to learn how to scope a project based
                        on limited time and resources, and develop a general framework for a project, including moments
                        for experimentation. This class is really what you will make of it. You can push the boundaries
                        of how software is conventionally applied, but we will also look at how to think of imaging on
                        practical and in sometimes more technical terms. We will look at kitbashing as a playful
                        technique of worldbuilding and at the dynamic properties of node-based shading in adding color,
                        texture, and depth to our scenes. Finally, we will
                        look at the ways your scenes can be animated in 3D space to create a final video project.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p><i>This syllabus is intended to give you guidance in what may be covered during the semester and
                           will be followed as closely as possible. However, I might modify, supplement and make changes
                           as course needs arise. Any changes will be announced on our Discord and reflected on this
                           website.</i></p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                     <h3>How will your learning be assessed?</b></h3>
                     <p>Grading is based on the exercises, assignments, and active participation. Focus, articulation of
                        ideas, and contribution to class discussions are all part of class participation. All work will
                        be evaluated based on (1) the fundamental idea and its originality, (2) the way the “look and
                        feel” of the work relates to the idea, and (3) the craft, meaning the details of the images,
                        motion, and fluency. </p>
                     <p>The numeric breakdown for all assignments follow:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>20% - Participation/Attendance</li>
                        <li>15% - Workshop Exercises</li>
                        <li>10% - Model Mash</li>
                        <li>15% - Alternate OBJ</li>
                        <li>10% - Final Proposal</li>

                  </div>
                  <p>~~~</p>

                  <div>
                     <h3>How do you assess participation?</b></h3>
                     <p>Your interest and enthusiasm drives the potential of the course. We will all gain from each
                        others participation. Participation involves actively engaging in discussions, coming to class
                        on time, preparing and engaging in our workshops and assignments, offering feedback, and
                        communicating with me. This class is meant to be a space in which you are encouraged and
                        supported in learning, building community, communicating, and taking creative risks. It is
                        important for you to play an active role in these endeavors! </p><br>

                     <h3>Additional Course Policies & CalArts Policies</h3>
                     <h4>What do you need to know about academic honesty?</h4>
                     <p>CalArts is a community of artists. In this community, all members including fauclty, staff, and
                        students are responsible for maintaining standards of academic and artistic honesty. As a
                        student and a member of the CalArts community, you are here to get an education and are,
                        therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic and artistic endeavors. You are
                        evaluated on your own merits. <a
                           href="https://policies.calarts.edu/all-policies/catalog/academic-misconduct"
                           target="_blank">Cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, or other kinds of academic dishonesty</a>
                        are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary action, as
                        determined by the faculty member, the dean of the student's school and the Office of the
                        Provost.</p><br>
                     <p>Plagiarism is the use of ideas and/or quotations (from the Internet, books, films, television,
                        newspapers, articles, the work of other students, works of art, media, etc.) without proper
                        credit to the author/artist. While the argument in a paper can be enhanced by research, you are
                        cautioned to delineate clearly your own original ideas from source material. To do so, CalArts
                        recommends introducing your source material (either quoted or paraphrased), noting when the
                        source material ends, and providing citations for source materials using standard documentation
                        formats. Misrepresentation of source material as your own original work and failing to credit it
                        is plagiarism. If you have questions regarding plagiarism or would like direction on how to
                        credit source material, there are reference guides on permanent reserve in the CalArts library.
                        Please contact one of the <a href="https://library.calarts.edu/c.php?g=495239&p=7737424"

                     <ul>
                        <li>What is the mood and mental state of this environment?</li>
