                        <p><i>Critiques are a dynamic way of gaining perspective on our works as a group that
                                energize us to move forward in our creative process. Being actively aware that we
                                are doing a critique helps to sharpen how a work affects us, expands our vocabulary
                                to talk about our work, and gives us ideas of how to improve our past, current, and
                                future work.</i></p><br>
                        <p><i>"Often times I find myself walking away from critiques feeling better informed about my
                                own work, motivated to keep working on my piece, or even inspired to start a new project
                                based on the conversations had. I see critiques not necessarily just vessels for either
                                validation or harsh, unwanted criticism, but as opportunities for constructive criticism
                                to help elevate the works of myself and others."<a class="tooltip" href="#">[x]

                                piece may set a direction for specific feedback
                                they have in mind. "I
                                find myself wanting to give a few words of direction initially so that I can gain
                                feedback in areas
                                that I find useful. This also helps fill in context for the audience" <a class="tooltip"

                                </a>. Only remember, this is NOT an opportunity to belittle your work. Respect the time
                                and effort
                                that went into your project. Respect your peers to form their own

                            <li>While contextualizing your work may help gain specific feedback, it is often more
                                helpful to not contextualize the work before viewing it (unless for a trigger warning).
                                There is time afterwards to add context but a first impression happens only once. "When
                                I had my video class, my professor let the
                                class speak and discuss first without any explanation from the artist. Without my own
                                intention, the class is more active, and their responses always surprise me by seeing my
                                work in different ways." <a class="tooltip" href="#">[x]

                            <li>Cold reads help to establish a common reality and impression of the
                                work from a formal level. This allows us to develop the same ground
                                as a group to question what the work is doing, generating, or
                                producing. What we call "cold read", Leeman calls “obvious, verifiable
                                observations about the object.”</li>
                            <li>Remarks on observable traits of a work helps us all build a working context and common
                                ground to deepen our interpretation and discussions for the work at hand. "If we skip
                                looking at the obvious qualities first, we start to pick and choose visual cues."

                                intention, you give the artist a respect they can grow into," as Leeman says.</li>

                            <li>Try to avoid art direction. If you think the work could improve,
                                try to form it into a question. For example, instead of “I wish
                                this piece included diverse clips from different movies…” you can
                                ask “why did you choose to include clips from this specific
                                source?”</li>
                            <li>Try to avoid the unborn sibling / comparing a work to something else. "This reminds me
                                of..."" is often gratifying and useful for students getting technically acquainted with
                                their own work but it can often deflect from the work into a space where we read the
                                work only by relationship to something else/other/outside. "I think sometimes, if not
                                elaborated on, associations can make an artist feel like their work is being viewed as
                                inherently derivative" <a class="tooltip" href="#">[x]
